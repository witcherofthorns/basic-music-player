# Basic music player (Desktop)
A simple music-player written in HTML, Css and JavaScript, i didn't use frameworks. The player was written in 1 day, so there may be some bugs in it, for me as a beginner, this is a kind of challenge

# How to use?
In the <code>app.js</code> script, an <code>array</code> is declared with all the music tracks and their properties (cover art, title, title, etc.), in order to add your track, just copy and paste your variant.
Since this is just an example, I did not describe methods for adding music tracks from outside (for example API)
